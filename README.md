I'm a student and currently learning Japanese with the [MIA or Mass Immersion Approach](https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/stage-1/jp-quickstart-guide/) during my free time. I'm working on tools to optimize my language learning journey. For examples, one key to add card to Anki in mpv, cli-dictionary with pitch accent information, text reader that support adding to Anki directly and displaying information from cli-dictionary, etc. All tools will be pushed to gitlab (link to be updated) once I'm feeling to do so.
