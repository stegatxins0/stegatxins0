Hello! I'm Jack, a student at ASASIpintar UKM (A pre university school) majoring in STEM. I'm the official webmaster for our school MUN conference, [GMUN](https://genmun.github.io/), and I've created a few programs to help me with my Japanese langauge learning journey. I love competitive programming, and also tinkering around with Linux.
